# INFR3120-Fall25-Project

While authentication is not required at this stage of development , the design prioritizes easy navigation to allow users to fully perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their incident reports through a simple, functional interface, ensuring the core application logic is solid before moving to advanced features. This foundational interface will be deployed and accessible via a chosen cloud service provider, representing the first complete functional release of the Web Application.
